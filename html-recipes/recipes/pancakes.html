    <p>A delicious breakfast treat!</p>
    <p>Pancakes are a type of flat, round cake made from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter, and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
